        During my academic year at ETS in the Engineering 
        Technology Path program, I gained hands-on experience 
        with technical drawing and programmable logic controllers 
        (PLCs). I completed coursework in computer fundamentals 
        and sequential logic while developing practical engineering 
        skills through laboratory work. The program's emphasis on 
        applied learning allowed me to gain experience with both 
        technical documentation and hands-on implementation of 
        engineering concepts.
        <br /><br />
        The key technical skills I developed included working 
        with AutoCAD for engineering drawings, programming PLCs 
        for industrial automation, and gaining foundational 
        knowledge in sequential logic systems. This practical 
        experience complemented my theoretical understanding and 
        prepared me for future engineering work.

         <section class="section">
          As a Computer Engineering Co-op student at Concordia 
          University since 2022, I've maintained an above 3.00 GPA while 
          balancing rigorous technical coursework with hands-on 
          projects. My academic journey has focused on both hardware 
          and software aspects of computer engineering, including 
          digital systems design, programming methodology, and 
          circuit analysis. I've consistently performed well across 
          semesters.
            <br /><br />
          In my project work, I've taken leadership roles in 
          significant technical implementations. I led a team of 
          seven students in developing a comprehensive peer assessment 
          platform using Node.js and PostgreSQL, demonstrating my 
          abilities in full-stack development and team coordination using agile. 
          Additionally, I headed an autonomous hovercraft development 
          project, utilizing Arduino and SolidWorks, which showcased 
          my skills in embedded systems and mechanical design and fluid simulation. 
          Recently, I completed my TensorFlow Deep Learning certification, 
          building various neural network applications. Through 
          the Institute for Co-operative Education program, I 
          successfully completed my first work term at Pratt & 
          Whitney Canada, applying my academic knowledge in a 
          professional setting.

      <section class="section">
      During my time at Pratt & Whitney Canada as a COOP Supervisor 
      in the Logistics and Handling department, I managed employees 
      in a unionized environment while leading change management 
      initiatives during store factory outsourcing. I effectively 
      coordinated day-to-day operations, acted as a resource person 
      for the department, and successfully implemented RF scanning 
      systems to enhance productivity. My role involved working closely 
      with supervisors to ensure smooth departmental operations while 
      maintaining high-quality standards.
      <br /><br />
      Throughout this experience, I demonstrated strong leadership 
      abilities by independently managing multiple projects, monitoring 
      KPIs, and implementing strategic improvements. I consistently met 
      operational and urgent needs while leading various initiatives to 
      enhance departmental efficiency. The role required balancing 
      multiple responsibilities, from team coordination to process 
      implementation, all while ensuring effective communication across 
      all levels of the organization.
